# Face_recognition
This Python program utilizes the OpenCV library for detecting faces in images or video streams. After processing, any changes made to the content, such as marked bounding boxes, are saved as a file. This file is then transferred to the same server over a Wi-Fi network using HTTP. The program is an efficient solution for scenarios requiring real-time face detection and seamless file sharing, such as in IoT applications, smart home devices, or cloud-based analysis systems.
